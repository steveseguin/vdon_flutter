# Social Stream WebRTC Reconnection - IMPLEMENTED ✅

## Implemented VDO.Ninja-Aligned Features

### 1. ✅ Automatic WebSocket Reconnection with Exponential Backoff
- WebSocket automatically reconnects on disconnect/error
- Exponential backoff: 5s, 10s, 20s... up to 30s max
- Maximum 10 reconnection attempts
- Reconnection canceled when manually disconnected

### 2. ✅ UUID Persistence Across Reconnections
- UUID is stored in `_persistentUuid`
- Reused on reconnection attempts to maintain identity
- Prevents the need to re-establish all peer relationships

### 3. ✅ Connection State Monitoring with Platform-Specific Timeouts
- Windows: 10 second timeout for disconnected state
- Other platforms: 5 second timeout (macOS, iOS, Android, Linux)
- Automatic cleanup of stale connections
- Proper state transitions: connected → disconnected → failed → closed

### 4. ✅ ICE Restart Mechanism
- Attempts ICE restart on connection failure
- Creates new offer with `iceRestart: true` flag
- Preserves session ID during restart
- Falls back to connection cleanup if ICE restart fails

### 5. ✅ Comprehensive Connection Cleanup
- Cancels all timers (close timeouts, heartbeats)
- Closes data channels properly
- Closes peer connections
- Cleans up all mappings and session data
- Triggers reconnection if all connections lost

### 6. ✅ Connection Success Reset
- Reconnection attempt counter resets on successful connection
- Happens when:
  - Seed confirmed by server
  - Peer connection established
  - WebRTC connection state becomes connected

## Code Structure

### Key Properties Added:
```dart
Timer? _reconnectTimer;
int _reconnectAttempts = 0;
final int _maxReconnectAttempts = 10;
final int _baseReconnectDelay = 5000; // 5 seconds
String? _persistentUuid; // Preserve UUID across reconnections
Map<String, Timer> _closeTimeouts = {};
```

### Key Methods Added:
- `_scheduleReconnect()` - Handles exponential backoff reconnection
- `_handleConnectionFailure(String uuid)` - ICE restart logic
- `_cleanupPeerConnection(String uuid)` - Comprehensive cleanup
- `_scheduleCloseTimeout(String uuid, int delayMs)` - Platform-specific timeouts
- `_cancelCloseTimeout(String uuid)` - Timer management

## Testing the Reconnection Logic

### 1. Network Interruption Test
- Start Social Stream with WebRTC mode
- Disconnect network for 10+ seconds
- Should see reconnection attempts in console
- Connection should recover automatically

### 2. Server Restart Test
- Connect to Social Stream
- Restart the signaling server
- Should reconnect with same UUID

### 3. ICE Failure Test
- Block STUN servers temporarily
- Should trigger ICE restart
- Connection should recover

### 4. Platform-Specific Timeout Test
- Test on Windows vs macOS
- Windows should wait 10s before cleanup
- macOS should wait 5s before cleanup

## Still TODO (Future Improvements)

1. **Network Change Detection**
   - Add connectivity_plus package
   - Monitor network state changes
   - Proactive reconnection on network restoration

2. **Connection Quality Monitoring**
   - Monitor packet loss and RTT
   - Trigger reconnection on poor quality
   - Adaptive quality thresholds

3. **Enhanced Safari/iOS Heartbeat**
   - Platform-specific heartbeat intervals
   - Detect Safari-specific connection issues
   - More aggressive heartbeat on iOS

## Console Output to Expect

### During Normal Operation:
```
[SocialStream-WebRTC] Connection state for UUID: RTCPeerConnectionStateConnected
[SocialStream-WebRTC] === PEER CONNECTION ESTABLISHED ===
```

### During Disconnection:
```
[SocialStream-WebRTC] Connection disconnected - scheduling 5000 ms timeout
[SocialStream-WebRTC] WebSocket closed
[SocialStream] Scheduling reconnect attempt 1 in 5000ms
```

### During Reconnection:
```
[SocialStream] Executing reconnection attempt 1
[SocialStream-WebRTC] Reusing UUID for reconnection: [uuid]
[SocialStream-WebRTC] Connection state for UUID: RTCPeerConnectionStateConnected
```

### During ICE Restart:
```
[SocialStream] Connection failed for UUID - attempting ICE restart
[SocialStream] Attempting ICE restart for UUID
[SocialStream] Sending ICE restart offer to UUID
```

The Social Stream WebRTC implementation now has robust reconnection logic aligned with VDO.Ninja's production-quality approach!
