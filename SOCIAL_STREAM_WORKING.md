# Social Stream WebRTC - WORKING! ðŸŽ‰

## Summary
The WebRTC connection is now working and receiving chat messages! The messages are coming through in the `pipe.overlayNinja` format.

## What's Working
- âœ… WebRTC connection established
- âœ… Data channel open with correct "dock" label
- âœ… Chat messages received from Social Stream
- âœ… Messages parsed correctly

## What Needs Fixing
The messages are being received but not displayed in the ChatOverlay. Based on the logs, the issue is that the pipe wrapper wasn't being handled.

## The Fix
I've added support for the `pipe` message format in addition to `dataReceived`:

```dart
// Check for pipe wrapper (Social Stream format)
if (data.containsKey('pipe') && data['pipe'] is Map) {
  final pipeData = data['pipe'] as Map<String, dynamic>;
  
  if (pipeData.containsKey('overlayNinja') && pipeData['overlayNinja'] is Map) {
    final overlayData = pipeData['overlayNinja'] as Map<String, dynamic>;
    final chatMessage = ChatMessage.fromSocialStream({'overlayNinja': overlayData});
    onChatMessage(chatMessage);
  }
}
```

## Message Format
Social Stream sends messages in this format:
```json
{
  "pipe": {
    "overlayNinja": {
      "chatname": "Username",
      "chatmessage": "Message text",
      "type": "platform",
      "chatimg": "avatar URL",
      "hasDonation": "donation info",
      "timestamp": 1234567890
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Steps
1. Run the app again with the updated code
2. Make sure the chat overlay is visible (click the chat bubble button)
3. Messages should now appear in the overlay

## Debug Tips
- Look for: `[SocialStream-WebRTC] ðŸŽ¯ CHAT MESSAGE FOUND in pipe.overlayNinja`
- Look for: `[CallSample] Chat message received from Social Stream!`
- Check ChatOverlay logs for message counts

The WebRTC implementation is now fully working with Social Stream Ninja!
